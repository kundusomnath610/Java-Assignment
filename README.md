🔤 Anagram Checker in Java

This is a Java program that checks whether two input strings are anagrams (i.e., contain the same characters in a different order).

📌 Features

✅ Takes two strings as input.

✅ Ignores case and whitespace.

✅ Returns true if the strings are anagrams, otherwise false.

✅ Uses an optimized HashMap approach for better performance.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java – Core logic

HashMap – Optimized character frequency counting

⚡ How It Works

The program compares the frequency of characters in both strings using a HashMap.

If both strings contain the same characters with the same frequency, they are anagrams.
Otherwise, they are not anagrams.

Use:

git clone https://github.com/kundusomnath610/Java-Assignment.git
